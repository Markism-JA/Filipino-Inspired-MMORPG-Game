# I. Core Mechanics

These are the systems that define the core gameplay experience of the game
Each mechanic reflects the world’s foundation — a realm forged from the bodies of gods, powered by Perlas, and driven by the mortal struggle in the Divine War.

---

## **1. Hybrid Combat**

**Combat in game merges skill-based action and targeted precision to represent the mortal channeling of divine energy through an Anito Pact.**  
Every strike, dodge, and invocation mirrors the fragile balance between mortal skill and divine power — the essence of being an Heir.

- **Targeting:**  
    Combat uses a **soft-lock system** that allows players to track enemy health, buffs, and debuffs, while maintaining freedom of movement and aim.
    
    - Players can manually aim skills, projectiles, and attacks for precision-based combat.
    
    - The system favors **player awareness and reaction**, rewarding timing, positioning, and stamina management.
    
    - Hybrid targeting ensures accessibility for new players while keeping the mechanical depth expected of action combat.
    

---

- **Telegraphs:**  
    Abilities and enemy attacks display **visual indicators** — glowing lines, sigils, or zones — representing divine or void energy.
    
    - **Divine Attacks:** Golden or blue telegraphs, symbolizing blessings and sacred techniques.
    
    - **Void Attacks:** Dark or crimson telegraphs, representing corruption and Bakunawa’s influence.
    
    - Players must **read and react** to these patterns, dodging, parrying, or interrupting as needed.
    
    - Certain boss mechanics include layered telegraphs (e.g., delayed explosions, circular void ruptures), promoting skill mastery.
        

---

- **Skill Activation:**  
    Skills are categorized into **Mortal**, **Divine**, and **Corrupted** tiers:
    
    - _Mortal Skills:_ Basic attacks.
    
    - _Divine Skills:_ Empowered abilities that consume **Mana**  granted by the Anito Pact.
    
    - _Corrupted Skills:_ High-risk abilities channeling void essence, offering massive power at the cost of health or corruption buildup.  
    
        Players can chain skills for **combo effects**, amplifying power based on precision timing or elemental alignment.
        

---

- **Enemy Behavior:**  
    Enemies utilize **pattern-based AI**, escalating attacks based on player performance or corruption level in the zone.
    
    - Low-tier mobs attack predictably, teaching timing and spacing.
    
    - Mid-tier creatures (like Tandayag Boars or Baku-kin Acolytes) use delayed or multi-directional telegraphs.
    
    - Bosses adapt dynamically — interrupting combos, using fake telegraphs, or summoning void storms in corrupted arenas.
    

---

- **Party Synergy:**  
    Group combat emphasizes **team coordination** through buff stacking, role synergy, and ability chaining.
    
    - _Example:_ A Babaylan’s Spirit Ward can absorb a Bayani’s overcharged strike to release an area burst.
        
    - _Example:_ A Mangangaso’s trap can amplify a Lihim’s backstab damage when timed correctly.  
        This system rewards **strategic execution** over simple damage output, reinforcing the divine cooperation of the Anito’s Heirs.

---

## **2. Traversal**

**Players explore Licalibutan, the sleeping body of the Earth God, traveling between the three great kingdoms — Amihan, Sinaya, and Ibalon.**  
Every path, current, and mountain is part of a divine corpse, and every journey reflects a mortal’s pilgrimage through the remains of creation.

---

**Movement:**  
    Players can freely move through diverse landscapes — dense jungles, volcanic plains, and floating isles formed from Licalibutan’s bones and veins. Certain terrains, such as corrupted zones or volcanic grounds, slow movement  encouraging preparation and resource management. 
    
---

**Mounts:**  
Mounts serve as both practical transport and spiritual companions.

- Examples include **Carabaos**, known for endurance and cargo carrying; **Horses**, prized for speed and mobility; and **Tamaraws**, aggressive battle mounts capable of charging attacks.

- Advanced players may acquire **Anito-blessed mounts** — creatures infused with divine fragments that glow or gain special traversal abilities, such as water-walking or brief flight.

- Mounts can be equipped with saddlebags for hauling trade goods or upgraded with armor for **mount combat** in Contested Zones.

---

**Vessels:**  
Traveling across the vast seas of Sinaya requires vessels — handcrafted or summonable ships designed for exploration, trade, and warfare.

- Early players start with small fishing boats for basic transport and resource gathering.

- Higher-tier vessels include **Balangay Ships**, **Guild Galleons**, which can be upgraded through crafting or faction reputation.

- Vessels allow players to traverse regions, trade between ports.

- Sea travel integrates with the **Hauling and Trade Loop**, where players risk their cargo for high-value returns between kingdoms.

- Lore-wise, each ship carries the blessing of **Aman Sinaya**, ensuring safe passage through turbulent waters — unless corrupted by the Void.

---

- **Fast Travel:**  
    For long-distance transport, players may use **Summoning Scrolls** bought from merchants or earned via quests. When used, the scroll summons the **Kuchero**, a spectral carriage spirit bound to the Divine Roadways that connect sanctuaries.
    
    - The Kuchero ferries players swiftly between **major towns, sanctuaries, and faction hubs**, but its reach is limited to **Safe and Contested Zones**.
    
    - **Void Scars** and lawless regions cannot be accessed via fast travel, forcing players to travel manually or rely on guild caravans.
    
    - In-lore, Kucheros are said to be **servants of Aman Sinaya** — souls of ferrymen who once crossed mortals safely between life and death.

---

## **3. Resource Gathering**

**Players gather divine and natural resources throughout Licalibutan, used for crafting, smelting, and progression.**  
Every resource represents a fragment of the divine — remnants of gods, spirits, and the shattered moons that form the living body of the world. Gathering is both a survival activity and a spiritual act of reclaiming creation from corruption.

---

### Trees and Flora

Licalibutan’s forests and sacred groves pulse with divine life. Each tree and plant embodies a fragment of the Earth God’s lingering essence.

- **Cutting:**  
    Harvests **wood, bark, and sap**, used for weapon hafts, structures, and furniture crafting.  
    Certain rare trees, like **Lisuga’s Silverwood**, may yield materials infused with faint starlight, valuable for enchanting.
    
- **Foraging:**  
    Allows players to gather **herbs, roots, and fruits** used by Babaylans to craft potions, salves, and shrine offerings.
    
    - _Common Finds:_ , Sap Pods, Spirit Leaves.
    
    - _Rare Finds:_ Moon Petal (in Amihan), Voidroot (in Void Scars), Sea Orchid (in Sinaya).
    
    - _Lore Link:_ These are the gifts of Lakapati, Aman Sinaya and Apolaki sustaining mortals in a broken world.


---

### Mining

Mining taps directly into **Licalibutan’s divine body**, extracting the metallic bones and molten tears of the Earth God himself.

- **Basic Ores:** Iron, Copper, and Tin — used in common gear and item upgrades.

- **Refined Ores:** Silversteel, Obsidian Shard — found in Contested Zones for higher-tier weapons.

- **Lore Link:** Each mined vein weakens or stabilizes parts of Licalibutan’s sleeping form, symbolizing the mortal struggle to balance creation and destruction.


---

### Fishing

Fishing connects players directly to **Sinaya’s domain**, harvesting life from the seas that cradle the shattered fragments of the moon. Conducted at lakes, rivers, and coastal fishing spots — especially near **Void Scars (Lawless Zones)** — fishing provides both economic and crafting resources.

- **Pearls (Perlas):**  
    Rare divine crystals born from the tears of Lisuga, the Goddess of Stars.
    
    - **Usage:** Essential for trading in the Talipapa, crafting high-tier gear, and converting into **$BAKU** at the Baku Forge.
        
    - **Sample Drop Rates:**
        - 5% chance to get 20 Perlas.
        - 1% chance to get 100 Perlas.

    - **Lore Link:** Perlas are the crystallized fragments of the shattered moon, containing the lifeblood of divine energy.
        
- **Fish:**  
    Found in multiple rarities (Common, Uncommon, Rare) depending on location.
    
    - _Common:_ Tilapia, River Catfish.
        
    - _Uncommon:_ Skyfin Tuna, Reef Serpentfish.
        
    - _Rare:_ Void Eel, Sinaya Koi (used in shrine rites and rare potions).
        
    - **Usage:** Potion making, cooking buffs, faction requests, and event offerings.
        
- **Seaweed:**  
    A common drop when fishing, typically traded in markets for **Pilak (silver)** or used in basic alchemy.
---

## **4. Looting System**

**Players may gain loot in different zones across Licalibutan, with enemy drops varying based on their difficulty, origin, and location.**  
Loot not only represents material gain but also the remnants of divine energy shed during the Divine War — echoes of gods, spirits, and mortals long perished in the struggle for power.

---
### Loot Bags Rarity Colors:

Each enemy drops a loot bag based on rarity, influenced by their type, level, and the corruption strength of the zone they inhabit.

- **Brown – Common**  
    Contains low-tier loot: general materials, base crafting components, and trade goods used in early progression.  
    _Examples:_ Pilak (silver), Wood, Leather, Ore, Raw Herbs, Simple Fish.  
    _Lore Link:_ Common loot represents mortal sustenance — the natural remnants of Licalibutan’s still-living body.
    
- **Blue – Uncommon**  
    Contains mid-tier loot with higher material value and limited divine resonance. These items serve as essential components for equipment enhancement, potion brewing, and shrine offerings.  
    _Examples:_ Divine Thread, Spirit Resin, Perlas Shards, Refined Ore, Offering Stones.  
    _Lore Link:_ Uncommon loot symbolizes the faint whispers of Anitos still lingering within natural resources.
    
- **Purple – Rare**  
    Contains high-tier loot used for advanced crafting and forging Anito-blessed gear. These items often come from elite monsters, dungeon bosses, or Contested Zone encounters.  
    _Examples:_ Charm of the Hunt, Woven Shellplate, Anito’s Echo, Blessed Weapon Core.  
    _Lore Link:_ Rare drops are imbued with concentrated divine essence, the spiritual residue of slain gods and corrupted Diwata.
    
- **Orange – Legendary**  
    Contains the most powerful, endgame-tier materials and equipment — artifacts tied to the lost gods or legendary battles. Only high-level bosses, raid entities, or world events can drop these.  
    _Examples:_ Oryol’s Scale, Haliya’s Moon Shard, Bakunawa’s.
    _Lore Link:_ Legendary loot represents divine relics — fragments of celestial beings and godly relics left from the Age of Calamity.

---
### Drops

- **Standard Rewards:**  
    All monsters drop **Pilak (silver)** and a **monster-specific unique loot**, ensuring every kill contributes to the economy and crafting loop.  
    For example:
    
    - _Tandayag Boar_ → Tusk Fragment, used in blacksmithing.
    
    - _Dogong_ → Abyssal Scale, used in armor crafting.
    
    - _Baku-kin Cultist_ → Void Ash Fragment, used in dark enchantments.
    
    - _Forest Anito_ → Spirit Leaf, used for alchemy or shrine offerings.
    
- **Zone-Based Rewards:**  
    Loot tables scale according to the zone’s divine corruption level:
    
    - **Sanctuary Zones (High-Sec):** Basic resources and crafting materials with minimal risk. Ideal for low-level farming.
    
    - **Contested Zones (Low-Sec):** Mid-tier materials, rare crafting components, and higher drop rates for Perlas Shards. Increased PvP risk.
    
    - **Void Scars (Null-Sec):** Highest loot tier with a chance for Legendary drops and rare components. Full-loot PvP applies, and death may result in losing unbound items through the **Soul-Tear** system.

---
### Loot Scaling

Enemy difficulty and group size affect loot yield:

- **Elites and Mini-Bosses:** Drop Uncommon to Rare loot with a small chance for Legendary fragments.
    
- **Dungeon Bosses:** Guaranteed Rare with a 10–15% chance of Legendary drops.
    
- **Raid Bosses and World Bosses:** Guaranteed multiple Rare and Legendary drops, with special components for forging **NFT Legendary Gear** (e.g., Oryol’s Scale-Mail, Haliya’s Blessing Staff).
    
- **Event Bosses (e.g., during the War for Montalban):** Offer unique seasonal rewards, banners, or limited cosmetic relics.

---

## **5. Questing**

### Main Quests (Mandatory)

Main Quests advance the epic storyline from the **Heir’s Awakening** to the climactic battle against Bakunawa’s Aspect in the **Baku-Trench**.  
Each act aligns with the events of the _Tome of the Shattered Moon_, slowly revealing the Divine War’s true scale.

**Examples:**

1. **“The Summons”** – Deliver evidence of the Baku-kin’s corruption to the three Great Kingdoms: **Amihan**, **Sinaya**, and **Ibalon**, forging alliances for the Divine War.
    
2. **“Oryol’s Gambit”** – Negotiate with the Serpent Goddess Oryol to uncover the locations of the Lost Temples. Choices here affect later acts.
    
3. **“The Siege of Montalban”** – A massive server-wide event where players defend Bernardo Carpio, the Living Seal, from Bakunawa’s assault.
    
---

### Side Quests (Optional)

Side Quests expand the world’s lore, deepen faction reputations, and reward players with crafting materials, gear, or unique abilities.  
They often explore regional myths, forgotten spirits, or the everyday struggles of mortals living on the divine corpse of Licalibutan.

**Examples:**

1. **“Echoes of Sinaya”** – A fisherman in the Sea Kingdom seeks help recovering a glowing pearl from a haunted reef. Completing it grants a **Lantern of Sinaya**, a light source and minor gathering boost.
    
2. **“The Smith of Ibalon”** – Aid an old blacksmith who claims to forge weapons with the bones of Tandayag Boars. Reward: a **Refined Ore Blueprint**.
    
3. **“The Sky’s Lost Prayer”** – In Amihan, a scholar asks the player to recover fragments of a forgotten hymn said to calm storms — lore unlock for Haliya’s followers.


---

### Event Quests (Limited-Time)

Event Quests are large-scale activities that unite or divide the player base, often triggered by celestial alignments or major lore events.  
They rotate seasonally or occur during server milestones, offering exclusive titles, cosmetics, and rare Perla rewards.

**Examples:**

1. **“Reinforcing Bernardo Carpio”** _(Server-Wide Event)_ – All players contribute materials and Perlas to sustain the Living Seal. Failure results in the **“Licalibutan’s Tremors”** world debuff; success grants server-wide buffs.

---

## **6. Inventory System**

**The inventory represents a mortal’s capacity to contain divine materials and gear — a reflection of how much divine essence their body and soul can endure.**  
In the game, inventory management ties directly into survival, trade, and risk. Every resource carried has spiritual and economic weight, reinforcing the themes of greed, loss, and divine balance.

---
- **Slots:**  
    Each slot holds one specific item type, categorized as **materials**, **gear**, **consumables**, or **quest items**.
    
    - Standard starting inventory has **30 slots**.
    
    - Slots can only store items of identical type; mixed stacks are not allowed.
    
    - Items displays rarity through colors.
    

---

- **Stack Limit:**  
    Each stack can hold up to **999 items** before consuming additional slots.
    
    - _Common resources_ (e.g., wood, ore, herbs) stack easily, supporting large-scale crafting or trade.
        
    - _Divine resources_ (e.g., Perlas, Blessed Shards, Void Ash) have lower spiritual thresholds and may stack less efficiently due to their volatility.
        
    - Certain rare or quest-specific items are **soulbound**, meaning they cannot be dropped, traded, or transferred.
        

---

- **Backpacks and Capacity:**  
    Players can equip **backpacks** or **satchels** to increase their carrying capacity.
    
    - Backpacks come in various tiers.
    
    - Some backpacks have **specialized compartments** (e.g., _Forager’s Bag_ for herbs, _Miner’s Pouch_ for ores).
        
    - Guild and caravan systems allow access to **shared storage**, ideal for group trading and long-distance hauling.
        

---

- **Quick Access & Sorting:**  
    Players may assign up to **10 items** to the Quick Access Bar for rapid use in combat or gathering.
    
    - Items can be auto-sorted by **type**, **rarity**, or **weight**, with filters for crafting, questing, or trade.
        
    - Divine items emit visual glows based on rarity color (Brown, Blue, Purple, Orange), helping players identify high-value materials during looting or inventory checks.
        

---

- **Storage & Banking:**
    
    - Towns and faction hubs contain **Anito Store, which function as safe storage spaces.
        
    - Items stored in storage spaces are protected from the **Soul-Tear** system, ensuring divine materials are not lost upon death.
        
    - Guild Halls have **communal treasuries**, allowing shared access to resources for crafting, raid preparation etc.
        

---

- **Loss & Risk System:**  
    In **Void Scar zones**, death results in the loss of **unbound materials and divine items**.
    
    - Lost items drop as **Soul Fragments**, recoverable by returning to the death location or defeating the creature that claimed them.
        
    - Repeated deaths cause permanent degradation of divine items (referred to as **Soul Decay**).
        
    - Recovery rituals can be performed at Babaylan Shrines to reclaim partial losses.
        
    - This system reinforces _risk versus reward_ — the deeper one delves into corruption, the more they risk losing spiritual and material wealth.
    
---

- **Lore Link:**  
    The inventory embodies the **mortal spirit’s burden** — the weight of divine power carried within fragile flesh. Each Perla, shard, or relic adds strain to the soul, and when death strikes in corrupted lands, that essence returns to the void. Managing one’s inventory is therefore not only about storage but about **balancing greed, faith, and survival** in a world still haunted by the Divine War.

---

## **7. Trading System**

### Trade Methods

- **NPC Merchants:**  
    Found in every major town and kingdom hub. Sell basic goods (potions, scrolls, repair kits) and buy common items at set prices. Prices fluctuate slightly based on local **faction prosperity** and **market demand**.
    
- **Player-to-Player Trade:**  
    Allows direct item exchange between players. Trade can be secured with Pilak or Perlas.
    
- **Market Stalls (Talipapa):**  
    Regional bazaars where players list items for sale. Prices are determined by supply and demand.
    
    - **Listing Fees:** Paid in Perlas.
        
    - **Transaction Tax:** A percentage of each sale goes back to liquidity, marketing and rewards.
        
        
- **Guild Trading and Caravans:**  
    Guilds can establish **trade routes** between kingdoms, transporting goods for profit or faction reputation.
    
    - Caravans risk **ambushes** or **player raids**.
        
        
    - Guilds controlling trade hubs may influence **regional prices** and **import/export flow**.
        

---

### Currencies

- **Pilak (Silver):**  
    The standard mortal currency used for everyday trade, repairs, and crafting fees. It represents the physical labor and material wealth of mortals.
    
- **Perlas (Divine Fragments):**  
    The raw spiritual energy crystallized from the shattered moon. Perlas serve as a **premium resource** for trading, crafting, and refining.
    
    - Can be gathered through gameplay (mining, fishing, quests).
        
    - Used in **offerings**, **gear enhancement**, and conversion to $BAKU.
        
    - Unstable in high quantities — lost upon death in **Soul-Tear**.
        
- **$BAKU (Refined Essence):**  
    The highest-tier currency, symbolizing stabilized divine energy. Created at the **Baku Forge** through the **Divine Tithe** — a ritual refinement process requiring both **Perlas** and mortal essence.
    
    - Used for **gear upgrading**, **skill progression**, and **minting high-value items**.
        
    - Represents spiritual mastery — mortals refining divine chaos into order.
        
    - Tradeable across kingdoms and stored securely in **Divine Ledgers** or **Faction Vaults**.
        

---

### Lore Link

The **Baku Forge** refines **Perlas into $BAKU**, transforming unstable divine energy into pure essence.  
This process symbolizes **mortal dominion over chaos**, echoing the eternal struggle between the order of the gods and Bakunawa’s corruption.  
Trade is thus not merely an exchange of goods — it is the heartbeat of civilization, a fragile balance between survival, greed, and divine consequence.

---

## **8. Personal Resource Management**

**Players manage three key personal resources that govern survival, combat flow, and divine energy usage.**  
These resources represent the mortal struggle to balance **body, spirit, and divine essence** — the triad that defines every Anito’s Heir in game.

---

### Health (HP)

- Represents the **vital essence** of the mortal body. It depletes when the player takes physical damage, suffers corruption effects, or is struck by void-infused attacks.
    
- When Health reaches zero, the player experiences a **Soul-Tear**, resulting in death penalties such as experience loss, item decay, or resource drop (depending on the zone).
    
- Health can be restored through **potions, Babaylan healing rites, regeneration skills, or divine blessings** obtained from shrines.
    
- Some enemies and curses reduce **maximum HP**, symbolizing corruption damage that must be purified at sanctuaries.
    

_Lore Note:_ Health mirrors the mortal vessel’s resilience against divine energy and void corruption — the line between life and dissolution.

---

### Mana (MP)

- Represents the **divine channel** that links the Heir to their Anito Pact.
    
- Consumed when using divine or spirit-based abilities such as spells, summons, or Anito Techniques.
    
- Mana regeneration is gradual over time but can be enhanced by **gear, buffs, or consumables** like Spirit Essences.
    
- Certain **corrupted skills** may draw from Mana and Health simultaneously, amplifying power at the risk of self-harm.
    
- Mana depletion leaves the Heir vulnerable, unable to call upon divine protection until the bond recovers.
    

_Lore Note:_ Mana embodies the Anito’s gift — a flow of sacred power borrowed from the divine realm.

---

### Sprints (Stamina Charges)

- Represents bursts of **physical endurance and spiritual focus**, used for **dodging, sprinting, or performing evasive maneuvers.**
    
- The Stamina system operates on a **charge-based cooldown** rather than a continuous bar:
    
    - Each **Sprint Charge** is consumed when the player dodges or performs quick bursts of movement.
        
    - Charges regenerate after a short cooldown or through specific gear bonuses.
        
- Sprinting is affected by encumbrance; overburdened players regenerate stamina slower.
    
- Advanced classes (e.g., Bayani and Lihim) may unlock **class-specific mobility passives**, such as double dashes or aerial evades.
    

_Lore Note:_ Stamina represents the mortal’s limited strength to resist divine pressure. Every breath, step, and movement is a measure of how much the body can endure the burden of godhood.

---

### Synergy and Strategy

These three resources are **interdependent**, encouraging tactical decision-making:

- Spending Mana carelessly may leave the player without enough stamina to dodge or block.
    
- Health loss weakens stamina recharge, symbolizing fatigue and divine strain.
    

High-level gameplay rewards players who maintain balance — a reflection of harmony between the **earthly and divine** within their Anito’s Heir.

---

### Lore Link

Health, Mana, and Stamina are not mere meters — they are manifestations of the **three aspects of existence**:

- **Health** — the Flesh of Man (Mortality)
    
- **Mana** — the Breath of the Anito (Divinity)
    
- **Stamina** — the Will of Spirits (Endurance)
---

## **9. Progression**

### Core Progression Loop (GDD Integration)

Progression follows the main loop outlined in the GDD, where every gameplay system connects through **earning, refining, and empowering**:

 **Play → Gather → Refine → Empower → Risk → Reclaim**

1. **Play:** Engage in combat, quests, or exploration to earn experience, loot, and materials.
    
2. **Gather:** Collect natural and divine resources (Perlas, ores, materials) across Licalibutan.
    
3. **Refine:** Convert gathered resources through crafting and the **Baku Forge**, transforming Perlas into **$BAKU**.
    
4. **Empower:** Use $BAKU and refined materials to enhance gear, skills, and divine attunement.
    
5. **Risk:** Enter Contested or Void Zones for higher-tier rewards — risking loss through **Soul-Tear** mechanics.
    
6. **Reclaim:** Recover lost items, rebuild, and continue the loop stronger, echoing the cycle of death and rebirth central to the game’s lore.

This cycle mirrors both gameplay progression and thematic philosophy: **mortals gaining divinity through perseverance and sacrifice.**

---

### Leveling System

- Players gain **Experience (EXP)** from combat, crafting, and quest completion.
    
- Levels increase **core stats** (Power, Vitality, Spirit, Focus) and unlock **skill trees** tied to the Anito Pact (class system).
    
- Experience gains scale with **zone difficulty** and **faction influence**, encouraging risk and exploration.
    
---

### Gear and Weapon Upgrading

- Gear progression ties into the **Item** **Enhancement System** - Upgrades weapon +1 increasing it's overall stats.
    
- Players enhance weapons and armor using **Perlas, Refined Ores, and Divine Fragments** obtained through gathering or trading.
    
- High-tier upgrades require **$BAKU**, refined through the **Baku Forge**, linking the economy directly to player power.
    
- Equipment rarities (Common → Legendary) determine enhancement difficulty and failure penalties.
    
- Some upgrades unlock **passive enchantments** or **visual transformations**, reinforcing identity and progression visibility.
    

---

### Skill Enhancement

- Skills evolve using **Perlas** (raw divine energy) and **$BAKU** (refined essence) through the use of tomes.
    
- Each class has a **Skill Tree** divided into three alignment paths:
    
    - **Mortal Path:** Focused on physical prowess and survival.
        
    - **Divine Path:** Harnesses Perlas for powerful blessings and area effects.
        
    - **Corrupted Path:** Utilizes Void energy for destructive abilities at the cost of health or corruption buildup.
        

---

### Divine Mastery (Endgame System)

Once players reach level cap, progression shifts toward **Divine Mastery**, a prestige-like meta layer defined in the GDD’s **Endgame Loop** section.

- **Divine Mastery Ranks (DMR):** Convert surplus EXP into permanent stat bonuses or minor divine abilities.
    
- **Anito Favor:** Earn favor from deities (e.g., Haliya, Lakapati, Kan-Laon) through dedicated quests, unlocking unique blessings or skills.
    
- **Reputation & Faction Influence:** Continuous activity within a kingdom (Amihan, Sinaya, Ibalon) increases access to exclusive merchants, mounts, or relics.
    
- **Relic Awakening:** Merge Legendary gear with divine relics to unlock ultimate powers.
    

---

# II. Secondary and Supporting Mechanics

These systems add depth, persistence, and social interaction, shaping the living world of the Divine War.

---

## **1. Boost System**

**Temporary boosts enhance player performance, gathering efficiency, and combat effectiveness, reflecting the mortal’s temporary alignment with divine power.**  
Boosts serve as short-term advantages obtained through **crafting, offerings, or exploration**, reinforcing both gameplay depth and the spiritual economy of the game.

---
### Overview

Boosts exist in two main categories — **Consumables (Potions)** and **Ritual Blessings (Rites)** — each tied to different gameplay loops:

- **Potions** connect to the **Crafting and Gathering Loop**, offering practical buffs.
    
- **Rites** connect to the **Faith and Lore Loop**, offering divine or situational enhancements.
    

Together, they represent how mortals temporarily borrow strength from the divine — a fleeting touch of godhood used to survive the Divine War.

---

### Potions

- **Crafting Source:** Created by **Babaylans** or through the **Alchemy Crafting System** described in the GDD.
    
- **Ingredients:** Gathered through foraging, fishing, and hunting — combining natural and divine materials (e.g., _Spirit Resin, Moon Petals, and Voidroot_).
    
    
- **Types of Potions:**
    
    - _Potion of Agimat Strength_ – Increases damage by 10–20% and health regeneration.
        
    - _Brew of Sinaya’s Flow_ – Boosts movement speed.
        
    - _Spirit Draught_ – Accelerates mana regeneration.
        
    - _Babaylan’s Elixir_ – Enhances drop rates or resource yield.
        
    - _Voidbrew (Corrupted)_ – Greatly boosts power but drains health per second.

## **2. Death Penalties**

**Death in game carries real consequences — both mechanical and spiritual — symbolizing the corruption of the soul and the fragility of the mortal vessel in a divine world.**  
Every defeat weakens the Heir’s connection to their Anito, echoing the **Soul-Tear phenomenon**.

---

- Group members or Babaylans may perform **Revival Rites**, reducing experience loss by half if completed within a short window.
    

---

### Respawn System

- **Respawn Timer:** 40 seconds (standard).
    
- **Location:** Respawns occur at **nearest safe town**, **sanctuary**, or **shrine** linked to the player’s Anito Pact.
    
- Death in **Contested Zones** respawns the player at the nearest faction-controlled outpost.
    
- **Void Scar deaths** require a **Soul Recall Ritual** or **item-based resurrection** (such as a “Charm of Return”), consuming resources or Perlas for revival.
    
- Players may choose to **corpse-run** to recover dropped materials or relics, risking further loss.
    

---

### Item and Currency Loss

- On death, players risk dropping **unbound items** (materials, Perlas, or crafting components).
    
- The chance of loss depends on **zone type**:
    
    - **Safe Zones:** No item loss.
        
    - **Void Scars/ Contested Zones:** Full-loot system — players drop all unbound loot, including Perlas.
        
- Lost loot appears as **Soul Echoes**, which can be reclaimed if the player returns to their death.

---
### Recovery System

- Players can **recover lost EXP and items** through shrines up to **two times per day**.
- **High-tier Babaylan NPCs** may offer **extra restoration** at the cost of perlas, linking the death system directly to the divine economy.

___
## **3. Fiat System**

**The Fiat System defines the flow of wealth, divine energy, and player progression across Licalibutan.**  
It governs how mortal and divine currencies interact within the economy, crafting, and reward systems — forming the **financial backbone** of in game, gameplay loop.  
Every transaction mirrors the balance between faith, labor, and corruption, reflecting the ongoing **Divine Tithe** — the mortals’ attempt to control the chaos of creation.

---

### Primary Currencies

#### 1. Pilak (Silver)

- The standard **mortal currency**, representing physical wealth and human craftsmanship.
    
- Used for **merchant trades, repairs, crafting fees**, and basic consumables.
    
- Earned through **combat loot, trade missions, NPC sales**, or **daily tasks.**
    
- Pilak has a stable value but limited use for high-tier upgrades.
    
- Often serves as the **bridge currency** between divine and player economies.
    

_Lore Note:_ Pilak symbolizes mortal effort — forged silver that once flowed through Licalibutan’s veins, now repurposed by mankind for commerce and survival.

---

---

#### 3. $BAKU (Refined Essence)

    - **Minting and player economy transactions.**

---

## **4. Dungeons and Raids**

These instances are not isolated battles; each victory or failure contributes to the evolving state of **Licalibutan’s world**, altering events, markets, and even celestial alignments in real-time.

---

### Dungeons

- **Player Limit:** 5 players per instance.

### Global Events (Dynamic World Integration)

Dungeons and Raids are tied to **Global Events** — large-scale, server-wide occurrences triggered by player activity, divine alignments, or corruption thresholds.  
These events merge narrative progression with gameplay, ensuring that the game evolves dynamically.

#### Event Types

- **Corruption Surges:** Triggered when Void influence spreads too far. Increases enemy spawns and resource drop rates in affected zones.
    
    - Countered by completing Dungeons or Raids to restore balance.
    
- **Divine Alignments:** Occur during celestial cycles (e.g., Haliya’s Moonrise, Aman Sinaya’s Tide). Grants temporary world buffs (EXP gain, Perla yield, or $BAKU efficiency).
    
- **Server-Wide Purges:** Coordinated events where all players contribute by completing dungeons to weaken Bakunawa’s influence before a raid unlocks.
    
- **Faction Campaigns:** Guild alliances compete to cleanse or control Divine Sites for regional bonuses and economic power.
    

#### Global Event Examples

1. **“Eclipse of the Devourer” (Corruption Surge Event)**
    
    - Trigger: Bakunawa’s influence exceeds 80% in Void Scars.
        
    - Effect: Increased monster aggression and loot rarity globally.
        
    - Resolution: Players must complete three world raids to reverse the eclipse.
        
2. **“The War for Montalban” (Server Wide War Event)**
    

	- Trigger: When the balance between Divine and Void energies falters, the Seals of Montalban begin to weaken. This reawakens ancient Anito spirits and corrupted fragments buried beneath the region — igniting the War for Montalban.
    
	- Effect: The event manifests as a large-scale battle across the plains of Montalban, where players from all kingdoms must fight together or apart to contain Bakunawa’s corruption.
	
	- Resolution: If the player community succeeds in cleansing the Three Divine Altars of Montalban, the Divine Seal stabilizes, granting all players server-wide blessings (+10% EXP gain, +5% resource drop rates) for one week.

	- Failure to contain the corruption causes Bakunawa’s influence to spread, summoning The Corrupted Living Seal of Montalban. Gathering every player to fight it.
	
	- If the Living Seal remains undefeated, Montalban falls into darkness, increasing Void creature spawns and decreasing Perlas drop rates across all regions until the next convergence.




---

## **5. Guild and Clan System**

Players form **Barangays**, representing alliances of mortals united under divine patronage.  
These guilds embody the communal strength of Licalibutan’s people, serving as pillars of cooperation, faction power, and faith during the Divine War.

---

### Features

- **Offerings:** Regular guild offerings at shrines provide temporary blessings such as EXP boosts or resource gain.
    

---

### Integration

- Guild efforts directly affect **Faction Reputation**, **Economy**, and **Global Events**, influencing the balance of divine power in the world.
    
- High-ranking guilds may gain access to **local governance rights**, such as Baku Forge or Talipapa bonuses or reduced trade taxes.

Each piece carries traces of the Anito’s power, growing stronger or decaying with its wielder’s fate.

---

### Gear Mechanics

- **Durability:** Equipment gradually degrades through combat and must be repaired using **Pilak** or **Divine Materials**. In corrupted zones, gear degradation occurs faster due to Void exposure.
    
- **Upgrading:** Players enhance weapons and armor using **Perlas** and **$BAKU** at the **Baku Forge**, increasing stats or unlocking divine effects. Higher upgrades risk failure or partial loss, echoing the _Soul-Tear_ system from the GDD.

- **Rarity Tiers:** Common to Legendary; higher tiers allow more sockets and unique set bonuses tied to specific gods or regions.
    
---

### **Integration**

---
