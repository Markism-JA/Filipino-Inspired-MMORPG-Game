# Takipsilim Lore & World Overview

> _“When twilight falls upon the world, the balance between gods and mortals fades.”_

## General Details

### Game Title: **Takipsilim**  
*(English: “Twilight”)*

The name **Takipsilim** symbolizes the fragile state of the mortal world — a realm caught between light and darkness.  
Humanity now stands on the brink of chaos, threatened by the awakening of **Bakunawa**, the primordial serpent of the deep.

Her monstrous legions rise from the abyss, driven to gather the scattered **Perlas** — divine fragments of creation’s essence. These fragments, once unified, can reawaken **Bakunawa’s true form** and plunge all existence into endless twilight.

Only the **Anito’s Heirs**, mortals chosen by divine fragments, can prevent this fate. Their mission: to reunite the **Perlas** into **Baku**, restoring the balance of creation before the final moon is devoured.

## The Dawn of Creation — *The War of Sky and Sea*

Before time began, when silence ruled the void, three primordial beings awakened from nothingness:

- **Bathala**, the Skyfather — bearer of flame and life.  
- **Aman Sinaya**, the Sea Mother — weaver of tides and dreams.  
- **Ulilang Kaluluwa**, the Great Serpent of the Void — spirit of chaos and hunger.

For countless ages, these forces clashed. The heavens cracked, the oceans roared, and from their battles, **light and darkness bled into existence**.  
When Bathala’s lightning struck Aman Sinaya’s waves, the **first islands** rose from the sea — giving birth to the **mortal realm**.

Weary of endless war, the gods forged a truce — binding sky and sea in harmony.  
From their covenant came **the Seven Moons**, each glowing with a **Bathala Fragment**, symbols of peace and divine balance.

But from the void’s shadow emerged **Bakunawa**, child of Ulilang Kaluluwa.  
Jealous of the moons’ brilliance, she sought to devour them one by one.  
Each time she consumed a moon, **storms raged, seas boiled, and monsters crept from the abyss**.

When the sixth moon fell to her hunger, **Bathala struck her down** with divine fire.  
The shattered moon’s remnants scattered across the world, forming countless **Perlas** — **divine pearls infused with the power of the gods**.

These **Perlas** became the **lifeblood of magic**, pulsing with the essence of creation itself.  
Some chose mortal vessels, creating the **Anito’s Heirs**, champions of divine will who wield elemental magic.

From the dust and coral of this broken world, **mankind was born** — blessed by Bathala’s light, sustained by Ulilang Kaluluwa’s shadow, and nurtured by Aman Sinaya’s embrace.

Yet the scars of divine war lingered. The gods fell into slumber, and the balance waned.  
Now, the seas stir once more, and **Bakunawa prepares to rise**, her deep-sea armies gathering **Perlas** to form the **Baku Core** — the key to her awakening.

## Essence of Takipsilim

At its heart, **Takipsilim** is a story of balance — between gods and mortals, chaos and order, tradition and ambition.  
The world’s **magic (Perlas)** and **currency (Baku Coin)** share the same divine origin.

As twilight deepens, mortals must decide:  
Will they **restore the light of Bathala** — or **succumb to Bakunawa’s eternal night**?

---

## Problem
- No meaningful representation of **Filipino culture, mythology, and worldview** exists in mainstream MMORPGs.
- Existing MMORPGs heavily borrow from Western or East Asian lore, leaving **Filipino mythology** — rich with gods, spirits, and cosmic conflict — underexplored.
- Most blockchain-integrated or token-based games focus purely on financial gain, **lacking narrative depth** and cultural identity.

## Objectives of the Study

### General Objective
To design and develop an **MMORPG integrated with tokenomics and inspired by Filipino mythology** that promotes cultural representation while providing a player-driven economy through blockchain-based systems.

---

### Specific Objectives

1. **To conceptualize and integrate Filipino mythological elements**—including Bathala, Aman Sinaya, Ulilang Kaluluwa, and Bakunawa—into the game’s lore, narrative design, and world-building.
    
2. **To develop an immersive MMORPG system** that allows players to explore, battle, and progress through quests rooted in Filipino cultural and spiritual themes.
    
3. **To design and implement a tokenomics system** where the **Baku Coin (crypto token)** functions as both an in-game and blockchain-based economic resource tied directly to gameplay and lore.
    
4. **To establish the in-game resource economy** centered around **Perlas**, the primary magical essence used for crafting, progression, and conversion into Baku Coin.
    
5. **To ensure a seamless integration of lore and economy**, aligning gameplay progression, token rewards, and player ownership with the game’s mythological narrative.
    
6. **To promote Filipino cultural awareness and identity** by embedding native mythology into a globally competitive and technologically modern gaming platform.
    
7. **To develop a sustainable play-to-earn and play-and-own ecosystem** that empowers players economically without sacrificing narrative depth or gameplay integrity.
    
8. **To evaluate the system’s effectiveness** in achieving cultural representation, player engagement, and economic balance within a blockchain-based MMORPG environment.
