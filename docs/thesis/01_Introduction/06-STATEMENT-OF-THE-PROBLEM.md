## **Statement of the Problem**

The rise of blockchain-integrated games has created new opportunities for players through play-to-earn systems. However, combining cultural storytelling, engaging gameplay, and blockchain-based economies remains a developing area of study. There is a need to explore how these technologies can be used not only for profit but also for cultural expression, balanced gameplay, and sustainable virtual economies.

This study aims to address this by developing a Filipino-inspired Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) that integrates Filipino mythology with a blockchain-based player economy. The project uses a dual-asset tokenomics model with _Perlas_ (in-game currency) and _Baku Coin_ (blockchain token), linked through a smart contract system called the “Divine Tithe.” This system promotes economic stability by regulating currency value, reducing inflation, and rewarding player activity fairly through transparent and decentralized mechanisms.

Furthermore, the study also explores how Filipino folklore and mythology can be represented in a digital environment while maintaining technical and economic balance. By merging gameplay, culture, and blockchain systems, this research aims to contribute creatively and technically to game development, blockchain innovation, and cultural preservation.

**This study specifically aims to answer the following research questions:**

1. How can Filipino mythology and culture be effectively integrated into an MMORPG’s world-building, narrative, and gameplay systems?  
2. How can the dual-asset tokenomics model linking *Perlas* and *Baku Coin* maintain economic stability and fairness for players?  
3. How can the **“Divine Tithe”** system regulate currency flow and minimize inflation within the in-game economy?  
4. How can gameplay mechanics such as combat, quests, and trading be integrated with the tokenomics system to ensure fairness and sustainability in player progression?
5. How can blockchain infrastructure through smart contracts and the _Baku Coin_ token ensure transparency, security, and decentralized transactions within the game ecosystem?

Through these questions, the study aims to demonstrate how blockchain technology and Filipino mythology can coexist in a unified MMORPG system that promotes both cultural preservation and economic sustainability in digital game environments.
