# **Scope and Limitations of the Study**

## **Scope of the Study**
This study focuses on the development of a **desktop-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG)** inspired by **Philippine folklore** that integrates blockchain-based assets. The primary objective is to demonstrate the functionality of the game’s **core gameplay loop** and the **tokenomics system**, which utilizes in-game tokens and **non-fungible token (NFT)** assets to simulate a player-driven economy.  

The scope of the study includes the **design, implementation, and testing** of essential gameplay features, as well as the **creation and deployment of custom ERC-20 and ERC-721 smart contracts** on the Polygon test network. The level progression within the game will be **limited to Level 30** to effectively showcase gameplay balance and the functionality of the economic loop. This project is intended **solely for demonstration and academic evaluation**, and is **not designed for commercial release**.

## **Limitations of the Study**
The study is limited to a **desktop platform** and will **not include cross-platform compatibility** such as mobile or web versions. It will also **exclude full-scale multiplayer optimization**, **commercial-grade security features**, and **public blockchain deployment**. The NFT and token systems will operate **exclusively within the Polygon testnet environment**, without any real-world economic value or earning potential.  

Furthermore, the study does not encompass **large-scale player testing** or **long-term economic balancing**, as these are beyond the intended academic scope. These limitations are recognized as necessary constraints due to **time, technical resources, and the project’s focus on demonstrating feasibility rather than commercial readiness**.
