## Objectives of the Study

### General Objective

To design and develop an **MMORPG integrated with tokenomics and inspired by Filipino mythology** that promotes cultural representation while providing a player-driven economy through blockchain-based systems.

### Specific Objectives

1. **To conceptualize and integrate Filipino mythological elements**—including Bathala, Aman Sinaya, Ulilang Kaluluwa, and Bakunawa—into the game’s lore, narrative design, and world-building.
2. **To develop an immersive MMORPG system** that allows players to explore, battle, and progress through quests rooted in Filipino cultural and spiritual themes.
3. **To design and implement a tokenomics system** where the **Baku Coin (crypto token)** functions as both an in-game and blockchain-based economic resource tied directly to gameplay and lore.
4. **To establish the in-game resource economy** centered around **Perlas**, the primary magical essence used for crafting, progression, and conversion into Baku Coin.
5. **To ensure a seamless integration of lore and economy**, aligning gameplay progression, token rewards, and player ownership with the game’s mythological narrative.
6. **To promote Filipino cultural awareness and identity** by embedding native mythology into a globally competitive and technologically modern gaming platform.
7. **To develop a sustainable play-to-earn and play-and-own ecosystem** that empowers players economically without sacrificing narrative depth or gameplay integrity.
8. **To evaluate the system’s effectiveness** in achieving cultural representation, player engagement, and economic balance within a blockchain-based MMORPG environment.

## Problem
- No meaningful representation of **Filipino culture, mythology, and worldview** exists in mainstream MMORPGs.
- Existing MMORPGs heavily borrow from Western or East Asian lore, leaving **Filipino mythology** — rich with gods, spirits, and cosmic conflict — underexplored.
- Most blockchain-integrated or token-based games focus purely on financial gain, **lacking narrative depth** and cultural identity.
