## **Objectives of the Study**

### **General Objective**

	The primary objective of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a prototype of a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) that integrates lore and world-building elements rooted in Filipino mythology. The study seeks to incorporate traditional folklore, cultural narratives, customs, and mythological symbols into the game’s core design, environment, and gameplay systems to promote cultural appreciation and representation.

	Furthermore, the project aims to implement a blockchain-based, player-driven economy supported by the creation of a native digital token, which facilitates secure, transparent, and decentralized in-game transactions. This system is intended to promote player ownership, fairness, and economic sustainability within the virtual ecosystem.

	By merging Filipino cultural heritage with emerging blockchain technologies, the study aspires to demonstrate the potential of blockchain integration in enhancing player engagement, economic balance, and authenticity within culturally inspired digital game environments.

### **Specific Objectives**

###### 1. **To design a game world and narrative derived from Filipino mythological figures and epics:**

	This objective focuses on the creation of a **culturally immersive game world** rooted in the **mythological, folkloric, and historical traditions of the Philippines**. The goal is to craft a cohesive digital environment that not only entertains but also preserves and revitalizes Filipino cultural identity through interactive storytelling.

	The design process involves integrating mythological figures, deities, and legendary creatures such as _Bathala_, the supreme god in Tagalog mythology, and _Bakunawa_, the serpent-like dragon that devours moons, into the game’s narrative structure and environmental design. Each mythological entity will serve a **distinct narrative and world-building function**, influencing quests, conflicts, and player progression.

	The game world will reflect cultural aesthetics such as indigenous architecture, traditional attire, oral storytelling forms, and pre-colonial belief systems** will guide the artistic and thematic direction of the environment and characters. Ultimately, this objective seeks to demonstrate how **Filipino mythology can serve as a foundational framework for digital world-building**, while fostering appreciation for indigenous knowledge and heritage among local and international audiences.

###### **2. To architect a dual-asset tokenomics model linking "Perlas," the main in-game resource from gameplay, to "Baku Coin," a blockchain cryptocurrency.**

	This objective focuses on the design and implementation of a two-tier tokenomics system that connects the in-game economy to a blockchain-based cryptocurrency framework. The model introduces “Perlas” as the primary in-game currency earned through gameplay activities such as quests, fishing, events, or player-versus-player engagements, representing the player’s virtual achievements and economic progression within the game world.

	The second layer, “Baku Coin,” functions as the blockchain-based cryptocurrency that operates outside the core game environment but remains directly linked to the internal economy through smart contracts and conversion protocols. Players may exchange or convert “Perlas” into “Baku Coin” through a controlled, transparent process that ensures economic stability, fair value exchange, and resistance to inflation or exploitation.

	This dual-asset structure aims to promote a sustainable, player-driven economy that reflects real-world value mechanisms while maintaining game balance. It also serves as a practical demonstration of blockchain tokenomics integration.

###### **3. To design core gameplay mechanics that integrate with the tokenomics model.**

	This objective aims to develop and implement core gameplay systems that are functionally and economically aligned with the dual-asset tokenomics framework of the MMORPG. These mechanics serve as the foundation for player interaction, progression, and economic participation, ensuring that in-game activities directly contribute to and are influenced by the Perlas–Baku Coin ecosystem.

	The design will encompass key gameplay elements such as combat, exploration, questing, crafting, and trading — each linked to resource generation, consumption, or exchange within the game economy. For example, players may earn "Perlas" mainly through fishing but may include events, quests, and PVP. Similarly, spending "Perlas" on in-game upgrades, or market transactions will simulate realistic economic cycles, promoting active engagement and sustainability within the player-driven ecosystem.

	By embedding blockchain-related mechanics into traditional MMORPG gameplay, this objective seeks to achieve a balanced integration of entertainment and economy, where progression, risk, and reward are tied to transparent and decentralized systems. The design emphasizes fairness, player autonomy, and economic balance, demonstrating how tokenized value systems can coexist harmoniously with core interactive experiences in a culturally inspired virtual environment.

###### **4. To develop a functional Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) prototype demonstrating core features, such as character progression, combat, and lore-based quests.**

	This objective focuses on the development and implementation of a functional MMORPG prototype that integrates the essential systems required to validate the project’s design framework and tokenomics model. The prototype will serve as a proof of concept showcasing how gameplay, narrative, and economic systems can coexist within a blockchain-enabled game environment inspired by Filipino mythology.

	The prototype will feature core gameplay functionalities, including character creation and progression, where players can level up, acquire skills, and unlock abilities through continuous engagement; a combat system that combines strategic mechanics with dynamic player interactions; and lore-based quests that immerse players in storylines derived from Filipino myths, deities, and epic traditions. Each gameplay component will be integrated with the tokenomics infrastructure, allowing in-game achievements, rewards, and resource transactions to interact with the Perlas–Baku Coin economy.

	Furthermore, the prototype will demonstrate multiplayer connectivity, enabling real-time player interactions, cooperative gameplay, and community-driven engagement — essential characteristics of MMORPGs. Through this development, the study seeks to evaluate the feasibility, functionality, and player experience of combining cultural storytelling with blockchain-driven economic systems in a large-scale, interactive digital environment.

###### **5. To implement the core tokenomics infrastructure, including the "Baku Coin" token and smart contracts governing the on-chain conversion of "Perlas."**

	This objective centers on the development and deployment of the blockchain infrastructure that will power the game’s decentralized economy. It involves the creation of “Baku Coin,” a blockchain-based cryptocurrency designed to serve as the game’s primary token, and the implementation of smart contracts that facilitate the secure, transparent, and automated conversion between “Perlas,” the in-game resource earned through gameplay, and “Baku Coin,” the blockchain asset.

	Through the use of smart contracts, the system will ensure that all transactions, exchanges, and conversions between in-game and on-chain assets are executed in a trustless and verifiable manner—removing the need for centralized intermediaries. This promotes transparency, player ownership, and economic stability within the game’s ecosystem. The infrastructure will also support wallet integration, transaction validation, and data synchronization between the game client and blockchain network, enabling real-time tracking of economic activities and asset circulation.

	By implementing this tokenomics framework, the study aims to demonstrate the practical feasibility of a blockchain-powered in-game economy that aligns with real-world digital finance systems while preserving the immersive, player-driven nature of the MMORPG experience. This integration is intended to highlight the potential of blockchain technology in enhancing security, fairness, and sustainability in virtual economies.
