## Objectives of the Study

To design, implement, and evaluate an MMORPG prototype based on Filipino mythology, featuring a functional, blockchain-driven player economy.

1. To design a game world and narrative derived from Filipino mythological figures and epics (e.g., Bathala, Bakunawa).
2. To architect a dual-asset tokenomics model linking "Perlas," the main in-game resource from gameplay, to "Baku Coin," a blockchain cryptocurrency.
3. To design core gameplay mechanics that integrate with the tokenomics model.
4. To develop a functional Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) prototype demonstrating core features, such as character progression, combat, and lore-based quests.
5. To implement the core tokenomics infrastructure, including the "Baku Coin" token and smart contracts governing the on-chain conversion of "Perlas."
6. To evaluate the prototype's viability via user acceptance testing (UAT) to measure:

    a.) player engagement with the Filipino mythological elements,

    b.) the usability and perceived value of the economic system (Perlas-to-Baku Coin conversion), and

    c.) the effectiveness of integrating cultural representation with a token-based economy.
