# Polygon vs Immutable Comparison for Unity Game Development

## Overview
Comparison of **Polygon** and **Immutable (Passport / zkEVM)** for developing a Unity-based MMORPG. The focus includes onboarding, SDKs, gas, and blockchain integrationâ€”plus our plan to **create and launch our own token**.

## Comparison Table

| Category | **Immutable (Passport / zkEVM)** | **Polygon (PoS / zkEVM)** |
|-----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Ease of Use** | Simplified onboarding via Passport (email/social login). Great for non-crypto players. | Requires wallet setup (MetaMask, etc.). Higher entry friction. |
| **Gas Fees** | Gas-free for players (studio sponsors transactions). | Players/studio pay small MATIC gas fees per transaction. |
| **Integration in Unity** | Official SDKs (Passport, zkEVM) are improving fast, easier for beginners. | Mature ecosystem with many Web3 Unity libraries, but more manual setup. |
| **Smart Contract Control** | Limited flexibilityâ€”SDK handles most blockchain logic. | Full control; ideal for custom tokens, NFTs, or complex economies. |
| **Security** | Backed by Ethereum; Passport handles non-custodial wallets safely. | Highly secure, proven track record; relies on your contract security. |
| **Ecosystem Support** | Strong game focus, growing ecosystem (IMX Marketplace, Passport). | Massive ecosystem, many tools and partners, but less gaming-focused. |
| **Development Speed** | Faster for teams new to Web3â€”no need to manage wallet or gas logic. | Slower startup for new teams; requires blockchain knowledge. |
| **Player UX** | Seamless, gas-free, no crypto knowledge needed. | Users must manage wallets, gas, and tokens manually. |
| **Cost** | Lower upfront cost, but gas sponsorship may add future expenses. | Predictable gas model, but you cover all fees. |
| **Long-term Control** | Some dependency on Immutableâ€™s SDK updates. | Full autonomy over contracts and blockchain features. |

## Adding Our Own Token: Impact on Both

| Factor | **Immutable** | **Polygon** |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Token Creation** | Possible but less flexible; limited customization in SDK. | Full ERC-20/721/1155 supportâ€”easy to deploy and manage custom token. |
| **Liquidity Setup** | Need to bridge or list externally; smaller exchange exposure. | Larger DeFi presenceâ€”easier to add liquidity on DEXs (QuickSwap, Uniswap). |
| **Player Trust** | Newer chain, less token exposure. | Polygon is well-established, boosting token credibility. |
| **Control over Tokenomics** | Partially limited by SDKâ€™s predefined logic. | Full control; better for unique game economies. |

## Summary

| Use Case | Best Choice |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Fast development, easy onboarding** | **Immutable (Passport)** |
| **Deep token customization, control, DeFi integration** | **Polygon** |
| **For our MMORPG (own token + long-term economy)** | **Polygon is more suitable** â€” better token control, liquidity options, and long-term scalability despite extra setup work. |

## ðŸ§© Conclusion
Immutable is ideal for smooth onboarding and early player testing, while Polygon gives us full control for token creation and long-term sustainability.  
Since we plan to **create and launch our own token**, **Polygon** offers the flexibility, liquidity, and control our project needs.
