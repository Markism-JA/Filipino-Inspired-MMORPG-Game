# Incorporate Lore into Game Style (World & Character Design)

## World Building

### **Sky Isles (Amihan)**

Floating islands that shine under golden light. The cities are built from pale stones and vines that move in the wind. Architecture mixes ancient Filipino shapes with sky temples. The feeling is bright, peaceful, and divine.

### **Sea Kingdoms (Sinaya)**

Deep cities built from coral and shell. The light is blue and silver, reflecting from glowing Perlas. Houses grow from reefs, and the sea floor is full of statues of old gods.

### **Serpent Depths (Void Scars)**

Dark underwater trenches filled with glowing cracks and fallen ruins. The ground is broken and covered in ancient carvings. The air feels heavy, as if divine energy is leaking out.

## Character Design

### **The Anito’s Heirs**

Mortals who carry blessings from the gods. Their designs combine pre-colonial Filipino clothing, tribal fabrics, and glowing tattoos that show their element.

- **Bayani (Warriors):** Bronze and leather armor, strong and bold, tattoos glowing gold or red.
    
- **Babaylan (Shamans):** Spirit robes made of abaca and light, with pearls and shells that shine under moonlight.
    

Each heir’s look shows their power: **flames for fire**, **shells for sea**, **vines for earth**, **moonlight for air**.

## Bakunawa & Deep-Sea Armies

**Bakunawa** is a massive serpent goddess with scales like glowing pearls. Her body shines in blue and silver, but her eyes swirl like storms. She is both beautiful and terrifying.

**The Baku-kin** are her deep-sea warriors. They wear coral armor, serpent-shaped helmets, and jagged weapons that glow with pale moonlight. Their design mixes sea life, ritual markings, and dark magic energy from the void.

## Asset Design

- **Perlas:** Glowing pearls born from moonlight. Used as energy or decoration.
    
- **Bathala Fragments:** Floating shards of divine crystal filled with sacred energy. Each fragment carries a part of Bathala’s power and is marked with ancient runes that glow faintly with divine light.

## Moodboard

The visual tone blends **Filipino mythology** with **dark fantasy** — mixing woven fabric, glowing stones, and natural materials. Designs use **Baybayin patterns**, **spirit motifs**, and **ancestral tattoos** to show divine connection.
