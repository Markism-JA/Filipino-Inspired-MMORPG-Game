## I. Cosmology & The Ages of Creation

The history of the world is divided into four ages: The Age of Silence, The Age of Architects, The Age of Calamity, and the current Age of Mortals.

## 1. The Ages of Silence: The First God

In the beginning, there was only the vast, silent void. From this nothingness, the supreme mind awakened: **Bathala**, the Lumikha, the Maker (Source 1.1). He was the unmoving, transcendent creator who dreamt of a universe.

From His thoughts, He birthed the "First Generation," the two pillars of existence: **Kaptan**, the King of the Sky, and **Maguayan**, the Ruler of the Sea (Source 7.1). They were the "Architects," tasked with giving form to Bathala's dream.

But the void was not empty. Another being, born of the silence and loneliness itself, also existed: **Ulilang Kaluluwa**, the Orphaned Spirit, a colossal serpent of the clouds (Source 3.2). He saw Bathala's light not as a brother, but as a rival. He challenged Bathala for supremacy. This was the First War. It was a battle of pure creation versus pure solitude. Bathala, the Maker, was victorious. He slew Ulilang Kaluluwa and, to prevent his chaotic essence from unmaking their new reality, Bathala burned the serpent's body.

**[Creative Liberty]**: The "death" of Ulilang Kaluluwa was not an end. A being of pure void-essence cannot be destroyed, only scattered. His burning essence split and fell:

- His immense, primal **Hunger**, his **Avarice**, and his **Envy** of the light plummeted into the deepest part of Maguayan's sea. It tore a scar in the ocean floor—the **Baku-Trench**—where this essence coalesced. For an age it festered in the dark, eventually taking a physical form: **Bakunawa**, the Serpent of Avarice.
- His **Cunning**, his **Loneliness**, and his **Hatred** of Bathala's "order" drifted like ash onto the world to come. This "Void Ash" seeped into the shadows of the earth, waiting. It would one day be born as **Oryol**, the Serpent of Manipulation.

## 2. The Age of Architects: The Second War

With the cosmos secured, Kaptan and Maguayan's children, **Lihangin** (Wind) and **Lidagat** (Tides), gave birth to the "Second Generation": the four Elemental Gods (Source 7.2).

- **Licalibutan:** The ambitious God of Rock and Earth.
- **Liadlao:** The joyful God of Gold and Light.
- **Libulan:** The timid God of Copper and the Moon.
- **Lisuga:** The gentle Goddess of Silver and the Stars.

Peace reigned until **Licalibutan**, the God of Earth, grew jealous of Kaptan's power over the sky. He forged weapons of stone and volcano-fire and convinced his brothers, Liadlao and Libulan, to join him in a surprise assault on the Sky Kingdom. This was the Second War, the "War of the Elements."

Kaptan, in a rage at this betrayal, struck them all down with divine lightning. Their "deaths" became the physical world (Source 7.1, 7.2):

- **Licalibutan's** shattered, rocky body fell into the sea, becoming the **Islands of the Mortal Realm**.

- **Liadlao** was melted into a golden orb, becoming the **Sun**.

- **Libulan** was melted into a copper orb, becoming the **First Moon**.

- **Lisuga**, who tried to shield her brothers, was shattered into a billion silver fragments, becoming the **Stars**.

The world was now born: a divine graveyard, a wounded, living landscape made from the very bodies of the slain gods.

## The Age of Calamity: The Shattering

The Architects, Kaptan and Maguayan, were paralyzed by grief. To restore the balance they had broken, they created **Seven Moons** in the sky—six new ones to honor the slain Libulan (Source 4.1).

**[Creative Liberty]**: Bathala, seeing this, made one final intervention. He placed a **Bathala Fragment**—a seed of His own divine, ordering-power—inside each of the seven moons. They were to be the keys to elemental stability. He appointed the first **Diwata** (nature spirits) as their guardians, chief among them the warrior-goddess **Haliya** (Source 4.1).

This new light, however, attracted the darkness. From the Baku-Trench, **Bakunawa** stirred. Driven by the void-hunger of her "father," she had become obsessed with collecting pearls (Source 4.2). To her, the seven moons were the _ultimate_ pearls.

One by one, she rose from the sea and devoured them. The world fell into chaos as the Bathala Fragments were consumed. As Bakunawa lunged for the final, seventh moon, **Haliya** met her in the sky.

**[Creative Liberty - The "Perlas-Event"]**: This is the most important event in mortal history. Haliya's divine spear struck not the serpent, but the _sixth moon_ as Bakunawa was swallowing it. The moon, and the Bathala Fragment within it, **exploded**.

- The resulting shockwave of divine energy hurled the wounded Bakunawa back into her trench, forcing her into a deep slumber.

- The shattered remnants of the moon—infused with the divine power of the Fragment and the silver light of the stars (Lisuga)—rained down into the seas.

- These "Tears of the Moon" were caught by the giant clams (_Taklobo_) (Source 6.2). Over centuries, they cooled and crystallized into the **Perlas**—the divine pearls that now pulse with the lifeblood of creation.

The gods, having now witnessed _two_ cataclysmic wars, made a final, sacred pact. They entered the "Divine Slumber," a self-imposed exile of non-interference, lest their direct passions unmake the world entirely.

## 4. The Age of Mortals: The Divine War

Into this silent, scarred, and "god-haunted" world, the first mortals were born. Bathala, in his last act, planted a sacred **bamboo shoot**. Kaptan's wind and Maguayan's sea-spray blessed it, and the shoot split open to reveal **Sicalac** (Man) and **Sicabay** (Woman) (Source 7.1).

Born into a world overrun by monsters (e.g., **Tandayag Boars**, **Buring**)—creatures born from the chaotic echoes of the wars—mortals learned to survive by forging pacts with the world's lingering spirits: the **Anitos** (Source 5.1). The first to do so became the **Anito's Heirs**. Their legends, like the **Ibalon Epic** (slaying monsters) and **Biag ni Lam-ang** (binding spirits), became the blueprint for survival (Source 9.1).

Now, the present day. The "Divine Slumber" is ending. Bakunawa is stirring, and her armies, the **Baku-kin**, are amassing **Perlas**. Their goal: to build the **Baku Core**, a profane artifact to draw the five lost Bathala Fragments from Bakunawa's gut, forge them into a weapon, and devour the final moon.

This is the "Divine War": a war for resources, power, and the world itself, fought not by gods, but by mortals wielding their shattered legacy.
