# MAIN QUEST LORE: "THE TOME OF THE SHATTERED MOON"

The main story is an epic-length quest line divided into several acts, guiding the player from a newly-awakened Heir to the world's most powerful champion.

## ACT I: THE WAKING SHADOW

### Inciting Incident: "The Mark of the Anito"

The player is a simple mortal in their starting village (in Ibalon, Sinaya, or Amihan). During a cataclysmic "Void Scar" event—a localized earthquake and a swarm of new monsters—they are cornered and nearly killed. In this moment of desperation, their latent Anito pact awakens. The spirit of their Ninunò (Ancestor) or a local Diwata (Nature Spirit) manifests, granting them the power to fight back. This "awakening" brands them with a spiritual mark, identifying them as a new Anito's Heir.

### Quest Line: "The Trail of the Baku-kin"

A local Babaylan (shaman) recognizes the player's mark and reveals the monsters from the attack were not random. They were Baku-kin, cultists of the void, and they were not attacking the village—they were harvesting it, specifically targeting a small shrine that contained a relic imbued with Perlas. The Babaylan tasks the player with tracking the Baku-kin to their nearby staging ground (the player's first 5-man dungeon).

### The Revelation

Inside the dungeon, the player finds a Baku-kin commander performing a ritual. They are draining the Perlas from the relic and sending the raw energy to a "confluence." The player defeats the commander, who, in their dying breath, gloats: "You are too late... the Core drinks... the Serpent... wakes..."

### Quest Line: "The Summons"

The player returns to the Babaylan, who is horrified. "The Baku Core," she explains, "is a profane legend. A doomsday artifact." She reveals that the player's small fight is part of a global war. The player, as a new Heir, is now a target and a soldier. They are given their first major task: travel to the three Great Kingdoms (Sinaya, Ibalon, and Amihan), present evidence of the Baku-kin's ritual, and forge an alliance. This act introduces the player to the Faction Hubs, the Talipapa (Auction House), and the wider world.

## ACT II: THE SERPENT'S GAMBIT

### Quest Line: "The Council of Heirs"

The player earns "trust" with the three factions by completing tasks for them (faction-based quests). Having proven their worth, they are granted access to the Wardens of Montalban, the neutral endgame faction. The Wardens' leader, the "Hand of Carpio," reveals the full, terrifying truth:

1. The **Baku Core** is real.

2. Its purpose is to act as a _magnet_, drawing the five lost **Bathala Fragments** from Bakunawa's slumbering gut.

3. Once she has the Fragments, Bakunawa will have the power of six gods. She will rise, break the "Living Seal" **Bernardo Carpio**, and devour the final moon.

The Wardens have a desperate plan: find a way to _sever_ the Fragments' connection to Bakunawa, or _awaken_ the slumbering gods to reclaim them. But the gods are silent, and the location of their temples is lost to myth.

### Quest Line: "The Treacherous Path"

The Wardens' lore-masters have only one lead: "The whisper of the void knows the path." There is only one being who fits this description, a being who wants her sister to fail: Oryol, the Serpent Goddess of Manipulation.

### "Oryol's Gambit" (Key Questline)

This is the core of Act II. The player must journey to the Serpent Depths (a high-level zone) and find Oryol's hidden temple. She is found, not as a raging monster, but as a cunning, bored goddess on a throne of shadows.

She agrees to "help." Her "counsel" is the entire questline for this act. She knows where the lost temples are, but her information comes at a price.

- **Oryol's First Task:** _"The Baku-kin defile one of my sacred sites. They are so... loud. Cleanse it for me, and I will give you the 'Key of the Sky'."_ (This sends the player into a dungeon filled with _both_ Baku-kin and Oryol's own traps).

- **Oryol's Second Task:** _"A rival _Barangay_ (guild) is moving a large caravan of Perlas through a Contested Zone. They did not pay me tribute. See to it that their cargo... vanishes. Do this, and I will give you the 'Eye of the Earth'."_ (This forces the player into a high-stakes PvP-flagged quest).

- **Oryol's Third Task:** _"My sister's 'World Boss' (a giant Void Scar monster) is blocking a path I wish to use. Kill it for me, and I will give you the 'Voice of the Sea'."_

    With each "favor," Oryol gives the player a cryptic item that unlocks the path to one of the three lost temples. She is using the player as her personal "clean-up crew," directing them against her enemies (both Baku-kin and other mortals) for her own amusement and profit.

## ACT III: THE RACE FOR THE FRAGMENTS

This act is composed of three massive questlines that can be done in any order, unlocked by Oryol's "keys." The player is in a race against the Baku-kin, who are also trying to find and corrupt these holy sites.

1. **"The Key of the Sky" (Amihan):** The player travels to a hidden **Sky Isle Temple**. The temple is a 20-man **Raid**, corrupted by the void. The final boss is a monstrous, shadow-infused version of **Tiburon**. Upon its defeat, the player consecrates the temple and receives a vision from **Kaptan (Sky God)**, who grants them the "Blessing of the Sky," the first step to severing a Fragment.

2. **"The Eye of the Eath" (Ibalon):** The player finds the lost **Earth Temple** deep within a volcano. This is the **Kan-Laon Raid**. The final boss is a colossal **Tandayag Boar** made of living magma. Upon its defeat, the player receives a vision from **Licalibutan (Earth God)**, granting the "Blessing of the Earth."

3. **"The Voice of the Sea" (Sinaya):** The player must use a special ship to navigate a maelstrom, leading them to a sunken **Sea Temple**. This is the **Maguayan Raid**. The final boss is a horrifying **Abyssal Dogong** that has consumed the temple's former light. Upon its defeat, the player receives a vision from **Maguayan (Sea God)**, granting the "Blessing of the Sea."

With all three blessings, the player now has the "Divine Authority" to challenge Bakunawa's claim on the Bathala Fragments.

## ACT IV: THE SIEGE OF THE LIVING SEAL

The player returns to the Wardens of Montalban, victorious. But a catastrophic alarm sounds.

### Quest Line: "The World-Wound"

The Baku-kin, realizing their plan to corrupt the temples has failed, have initiated their backup plan. They have diverted all their forces to the Mountains of Montalban.

Their new goal: stop trying to power the Baku Core with Perlas. Instead, they will break the "Living Seal," Bernardo Carpio.

If Bernardo falls, the mountains will collide, killing him and shattering the very land (Licalibutan's body). This cataclysmic release of divine earth-energy will be enough to instantly power the Baku Core and awaken Bakunawa.

### "The War for Montalban" (Permanent Server-Wide Event)

This entire act is a massive, persistent war. The MQL merges with the global server event. Players must travel to Montalban and participate in a non-stop series of public quests, world-boss defenses, and resource-drives to "Reinforce" Bernardo Carpio, who is visibly struggling under a massive Void-Assault.

- If the server _succeeds_, Bernardo holds, and the Baku-kin's plan is foiled.

- If the server _fails_, the server-wide "Licalibutan's Tremors" debuff is applied, and all players are forced to regroup for a "final, desperate push" to reclaim the mountain.

## ACT V: THE TOME OF THE SHATTERED MOON

### Quest Line: "The Final Bargain"

After the Siege of Montalban is won, the player is summoned one last time by Oryol. She is furious. The Baku-kin's all-out attack was "messy, brutish, and bad for business." Her sister is now desperate. Bakunawa has begun a final, suicidal ritual: to consume her own Baku-kin to fuel the Core.

Oryol, seeing a total-loss scenario, gives the player the final key: the path into the Baku-Trench itself. "Go. End this. My world is not for her to unmake."

### "The Baku Core" (The Final Raid)

The player and their 20-man team descend into the deepest part of the ocean, the Baku-Trench. This is the final, epic-level raid.

- **Phase 1:** Fight through the Baku-kin's abyssal fortress.

- **Phase 2:** Defeat the "Keepers of the Core," three massive, corrupted bosses who are channeling energy.

- **Phase 3:** Confront the "Heart of the Core," the physical artifact, and destroy it.

### Final Boss: "The Aspect of Bakunawa"

As the Core shatters, a furious, half-awakened Bakunawa rises from the abyss. Her full form is the size of a continent, but her "Aspect"—her consciousness and power given form—emerges to destroy the players. This is the final, multi-stage, cataclysmic boss fight of the MQL.

### Ending Cutscene: "The Last Pearl"

Upon her defeat, Bakunawa's Aspect is banished back into slumber. The five Bathala Fragments, now severed, rocket out of the trench and fly into the sky, taking their place beside the final moon as five new, pin-prick stars, restoring the lost balance.

The player is hailed as the "Hero of the Seven Moons." The world is saved... for now.

The MQL ends, but the **Divine War (the player-driven, economic, and PvP endgame)** continues. Bakunawa is not dead, only sleeping. The Baku-kin are scattered, not destroyed. And Oryol, now free of her primary rival, is more dangerous than ever. The player's quest for power and wealth has only just begun.
