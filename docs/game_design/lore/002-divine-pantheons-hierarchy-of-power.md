## II. The Divine Pantheons: A Hierarchy of Power

This is the in-universe "who's who" of divine power.

- **Tier 1: The Creator God (Transcendent):**
  - **Bathala:** The Supreme Mind. The "Dreamer." He is the source of all, but does not interfere. He is the _concept_ of creation.
- **Tier 2: The Primordial Gods (The Architects):**
  - **Kaptan (Sky):** Slumbers in the Sky Kingdom, _Amihan_. His passive aura is what keeps the Sky Isles safe.
  - **Maguayan (Sea):** Slumbers in the Sea Kingdom, _Sinaya_. His passive aura is what keeps the Sea Kingdoms safe.
- **Tier 3: The Trapped Gods (The World Itself):**
  - **Licalibutan (Earth):** His body _is_ the game world. His "stirring" in his sleep causes earthquakes.
  - **Liadlao (Sun), Libulan (Moon), Lisuga (Stars):** They are no longer conscious entities, but the physical, celestial bodies.
- **Tier 4: The Patron Gods (Ascended Diwata):**
  - These are _not_ Primordials. They are the most powerful **Diwata** (nature spirits) who, through eons of mortal worship, ascended to godhood. They are the "Patrons" of the player classes.
  - **Apolaki (Sun/War):** Patron of the Bayani. (Source 8.1)
  - **Haliya (Moon/Hunt):** Patron of the Mangkukulam, chief adversary of Bakunawa. (Source 4.1)
  - **Aman Sinaya (Bounty/Sea):** Patron of the Manggagamot and Haulers. (Source 2.2)
  - **Kan-Laon (Volcano/Fire):** Patron of the Mangkukulam.
  - **Sitan (Underworld):** Patron of shadow-magic. (Source 8.1)
- **Tier 5: The Void Pantheon (The Enemy):**
  - **Ulilang Kaluluwa:** The "Slain Father." The source of the Void.
  - **Bakunawa:** The "Primal Hunger." The main antagonist. She is a brute-force fanatic.
  - **Oryol:** The "Cunning Mind." The secondary antagonist. She is a treacherous, manipulative schemer who despises her sister's artless "smash-and-grab" plan.
