# III. The Mortal Realm: Geography & Law

The world-map (Licalibutan's body) is divided into three security zones, defined by the "strength" of the slumbering gods' protective aura.

- **Sanctuary Zones (High-Sec):**
  - **Lore:** These are the factional capitals, built on land directly "blessed" by the passive aura of a slumbering Primordial (Kaptan, Maguayan). This aura repels the deep corruption of the void and enforces a "Divine Truce," making mortal-on-mortal violence impossible.
  - **Locations:** _Amihan_ (Sky Isle), _Sinaya_ (Sea Kingdom), _Ibalon_ (Earth Realm).
  - **Purpose:** The protected economic hubs for crafting, trading, and smelting.
- **Contested Zones (Low-Sec):**
  - **Lore:** The "wildlands" where the gods' aura is weak. The only law is mortal lawâ€”that of the Factions. Guilds (_Barangays_) can declare war here, and lawless _Mandarambong_ (Pirates) can prey on those who leave the protection of the Faction "peace."
  - **Purpose:** The "Hauling" loop. All major trade routes connecting the Sanctuaries pass through these zones, creating a risk/reward loop for logistics.
  - **Death Lore:** A mortal death here is simple. Your spirit is retrieved, but any unbound resources (Perlas, cargo) are left behind.
- **The Void Scars (Null-Sec / Lawless):**
  - **Lore:** These are the most dangerous and valuable places in the world. They are the literal, physical scars on Licalibutan's body where the "Void Ash" of **Ulilang Kaluluwa** first landed. The corruption here is so potent that it _overwrites_ divine law. The gods' aura is non-existent.
  - **Purpose:** The high-stakes, high-reward endgame. Home to World Bosses, Raids, and the richest resource nodes.
  - **Death Lore (The "Soul-Tear" Sink):** Death to a player here is catastrophic. The Void Corruption _tears at your Anito Pact_.
    - **Cargo Drop:** This tear shatters your connection to your held, unbound resources (Perlas, mats).
    - **Gear Damage:** A severe tear can _corrupt_ the divine energy matrix of your gear, "Damaging" it. It can only be repaired with a fresh infusion of **$BAKU**.
    - **Gear Shatter:** A critical tear can _shatter_ the item's matrix completely, "burning" its essence and destroying it _permanently_. This is the in-lore justification for the permanent item sink.
