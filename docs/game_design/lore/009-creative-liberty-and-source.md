# IX. Creative Liberties and Source Material

1. **Pantheon Synthesis:** This GDD _combines_ the Tagalog creation myth (Bathala, Ulilang Kaluluwa) with the Visayan creation myth (Kaptan, Maguayan, Licalibutan).
    
2. **Origin of Perlas:** The myth of Bakunawa being scared by mortals is adapted. In this GDD, the goddess Haliya _fights_ Bakunawa, and her strike _shatters_ the 6th moon, creating the **Perlas** resource.
    
3. **Origin of Bakunawa/Oryol:** Their "birth" from the slain Ulilang Kaluluwa is a creative addition to tie them together.
    
4. **Codifying the Anito:** The general animistic concept of "Anito" is codified into a game system (Bayani vs. Babaylan archetypes).
    
5. **Patron Gods:** Gods like Aman Sinaya, Apolaki, and Haliya are framed as "Patron Gods" to differentiate them from the Primordial creators.
    
6. **Tokenomics (Core Adaptation):** The entire economic model (**Perlas**, **$BAKU**, **Baku Forge**, **Divine Tithe**, **NFTs**) is a **100% creative addition**. It is designed to emulate the P2E tokenomics of _Mir4_ and the P2L economic sinks of _EVE Online_. The Bakunawa myth (her "avarice" for pearls) is used as the _narrative justification_ for this entire economic system.
