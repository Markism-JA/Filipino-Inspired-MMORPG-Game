### V. The Metaphysics of Power (The Magic & Economic System)

This is the in-universe justification for the game's core economic loop.

- **The Anitos (The "Spark"):** The base-level spirits of the world.
  - **Diwata:** Nature spirits (of a place, animal, or concept) (Source 5.2).
  - **Ninun√≤:** Ancestor spirits (of a bloodline) (Source 5.2).
- **The Anito's Heir (The "Engine"):** The player. A mortal who has forged a **Pact** with an Anito, allowing them to channel divine energy. This Pact is their "Class."
- **Perlas (The "Raw Fuel" / "Darksteel"):**
  - **Lore:** Raw, crystallized divine light from the Shattered Moon. It is _volatile, heavy, and chaotic_. It is the most common form of divine energy.
  - **Use:** It is used as a _catalyst_ for crafting, as an offering to spirits, and as the "mana" for powerful combat abilities. Its unstable nature means it is easily lost upon "death."
- **$BAKU (The "Refined Essence" / "DRACO"):**
  - **Lore:** Perlas is too chaotic for "high magic" (like permanent enchantments or binding a soul to an item). It must be _stabilized_.
  - **The Baku Forge:** This is not a simple smelter; it is a divine-tech machine, possibly left by the gods. It "Refines" the raw, chaotic Perlas, burning away the dross ("Licalibutan's Earthen Grief") and leaving only the _pure, stable, divine essence_.
  - This refined, stable, and "cold" energy is **$BAKU**.
  - **Use:** $BAKU is _pure, stable, divine power_. It is used to _permanently_ alter reality:
        1. **To Evolve a Pact:** (Leveling up high-tier skills).
        2. **To Bind a Soul:** (Minting a Character NFT).
        3. **To Imbue an Item:** (Minting a Legendary NFT).
        4. **To Claim Ownership:** (Weaving an "ownership" matrix over Celestial Land).
  - **The "Divine Tithe" (Lore):** The variable exchange rate is an in-universe law. The Forge is a "living" machine; as more Perlas is pushed through it, the "friction" and "heat" of refinement build up, requiring _more_ raw fuel (Perlas) to produce the same amount of pure essence ($BAKU).
