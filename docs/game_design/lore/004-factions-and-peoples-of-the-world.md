# IV. Factions & Peoples of the World

## 1. The Mortal Kingdoms (Player Factions)

- **The Amihan Sovereignty (Sky Isles):** Proud, aristocratic, and isolationist. They master airship technology and revere Kaptan and Haliya. The primary source of magical research.
- **The Sinaya League (Sea Kingdoms):** A sprawling, wealthy confederacy of port-cities. They are the world's merchants, traders, and "Haulers." They control the **Global Talipapa** and the **Central Baku Forge**. They revere Maguayan and Aman Sinaya.
- **The Ibalon Tribes (Earth Realms):** Hardy, pragmatic, and fierce. A land of monster-slaying clans. They are the world's master blacksmiths and beast-tamers. They revere Kan-Laon and their heroic ancestors (the heroes of the Ibalon Epic).
- **The Wardens of Montalban (Neutral):** A holy order of warriors and Babaylans dedicated to one task: aiding the demigod-giant **Bernardo Carpio** (Source 9.1), who serves as the "Living Seal" on Licalibutan's greatest wound, holding two colliding mountains apart. This is a persistent, server-wide PVE event.

## 2. The Hostile Factions (Enemies)

- **The Baku-kin (Cult of the Void):** The primary "mob" faction. They are fanatics who worship Bakunawa. They believe her victory will resurrect their "father" Ulilang Kaluluwa and unmake the flawed world.
- **The Serpent Cults (Oryol's Hand):** The "elite" hostile faction. They are spies, assassins, and illusionists who worship Oryol. They see her as the _true_ inheritor of the world and seek to control it from the shadows. They are in a cold war with the Baku-kin, whom they see as artless brutes.
- **The Mandarambong (Pirates):** Player-faction. Lawless mortals who have rejected the Kingdoms to prey on Haulers in the Contested Zones.
